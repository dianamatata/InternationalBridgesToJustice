('**Complete**: The chapter directly addresses the key point - Right Against '
 'Unlawful Arrests, Searches, and Seizures - with adequate legal detail.\n'
 '\n'
 'The wiki chapter provides a comprehensive breakdown of the procedural '
 'safeguards against unlawful arrests, searches, and seizures, with references '
 'to relevant sections in the Constitution and the Code of Criminal Procedure. '
 'It includes a detailed discussion of the right to be informed of the motives '
 'for arrest, the right to be presumed innocent, and the right to be assisted '
 'by a lawyer. Police procedures are also covered, with specific emphasis on '
 'the rights of the accused during the pre-jurisdictional phase and police '
 'custody.\n'
 '\n'
 "The wiki chapter could be enhanced by referencing the database's legal "
 'provisions. For instance, it could cite Article 39 about ensuring freedom in '
 'accordance with provisions of law, Article 43 about protection against '
 'arbitrary interference in private life, and Article 40 about presumption of '
 'innocence for a person accused of a criminal act. These articles could '
 "provide additional backing to the wiki's coverage of the right against "
 'unlawful arrests, and searches, and seizures.\n'
 '\n'
 'Overall, however, the wiki chapter is in line with the key point and '
 'provides detailed explanations, legal references, and specifics on the legal '
 'protections of the accused. It offers a clear view of the legal framework '
 'surrounding arrests, searches, seizures, and the rights of the accused in '
 'the process.')


# v1
('**Needs refinement**: The wiki chapter does provide an overview and address '
 'the right against unlawful arrests, searches, and seizures but it lacks '
 'specific detail and depth on this point. There is no direct mention of what '
 'constitutes an "unlawful" arrest, search, or seizure, or the guarantees '
 'under the code of criminal procedure, constitution, or any other relevant '
 'laws that specifically protect individuals against them. \n'
 '\n'
 'What is available in the wiki is valuable information about overall rights '
 'of the accused, such as the right to be informed of reasons for arrest, to '
 'be presumed innocent, to be assisted by a lawyer, not to be subjected to '
 'torture, to be judged within a reasonable time, to a public trial, to an '
 'interpreter, to silence, and to know the content of the case-file. However, '
 'the specific topic of rights against unlawful arrests, searches, and '
 'seizures needs a more focused definition and elaboration.\n'
 '\n'
 'In justifying this, even from the database content, *Article 39* is a direct '
 'legal reference for the protection against deprivation of freedom, and '
 '*Article 43* also mentions protection against arbitrary interference and '
 'infringement, which can provide key details for the right against unlawful '
 'arrests, searches, and seizures. This valuable information can be used to '
 'refine the given point in the wiki chapter.')
