## **Claim Extraction Instructions**

### Very important:

Here is an improved version of your prompt with clearer structure, more concise language, and a stronger ending that reinforces the constraints:

---

You are tasked with verifying how factual a sentence is. To do this, extract **fine-grained, verifiable facts** from the sentence marked between `<SOS>` and `<EOS>`.

Each extracted fact should:

* Be **independently verifiable** using reliable sources (e.g., Wikipedia)
* Describe a **single event or state** (e.g., "Nvidia was founded in 1993 in Sunnyvale, California, U.S.", or "UMass Amherst has existed for 161 years.")
* Include necessary **named entities, numbers, time, and location** details
* Be **fully understandable on its own**, without referring to prior sentences

Avoid extracting:

* **Opinions, suggestions, instructions, or hypotheticals** (e.g., subjunctive or conditional statements like ‚Äúwould be‚Äù)
* **Stories, personal experiences**, or **quoted narratives** unless the quotation is sourced and factual
* **Definite noun phrases** (e.g., "the president") unless fully specified or modified (e.g., "the president of the United States in 2020")
* **References or citations** (e.g., ‚ÄúArticle 12 of the Constitution‚Äù)

If a definite phrase is used (e.g., ‚Äúthe teacher‚Äù), add modifiers to fully identify it (e.g., ‚Äúthe teacher who led the 2019 protest in Chile‚Äù).
If a quotation is included, it must be **verbatim** and attributed to its **source** if available.

üõë **If the sentence contains no independently verifiable facts**, output:
`No verifiable claim.`

**Do not extract vague or context-dependent statements. Every extracted fact must stand alone.**
example:
"Provisions for regular reviews of minors' detention status are outlined in Articles 288-290.",
'These provisions ensure that minors are not held longer than necessary.',
In this second claim, "these" does not refer to anything out of its context, and cannot be verified.
