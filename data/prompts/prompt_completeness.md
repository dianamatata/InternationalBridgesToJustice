### Evaluation Instructions

1. Carefully read both the wiki chapter and the legal database content.
2. Determine whether the wiki chapter fully covers the key point with sufficient legal support.

### Inputs:

* **Wiki Chapter (to be evaluated):**

{database_content}


### Classification Criteria

* **Complete**:
  The chapter addresses the key point fully, referencing relevant legal provisions, and includes sufficient detail about rights, obligations, procedures, and exceptions.

* **Needs Refinement**:
  The chapter covers the key point but lacks one or more of the following:

  * Clear legal definitions.
  * References to specific laws (e.g., constitution, penal code, procedural laws).
  * Procedural details, enforcement mechanisms, or legal exceptions.

  In this case:

  * Use the legal database to identify and cite relevant legal articles.
  * Explain their relevance.
  * Rewrite the wiki chapter incorporating these legal references in clear, accurate, and accessible language.
  * Avoid vague phrases such as "under legal conditions" â€” always specify which law and article defines these conditions.

* **Missing**:

* Use clear, formal legal language accessible to a general audience
* Include direct references to laws and explain what they mean in context
