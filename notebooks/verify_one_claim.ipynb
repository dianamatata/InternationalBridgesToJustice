They are:\\n\\n**The right to be informed of one\\'s rights and the reasons for one\\'s arrest**\\n\\nThe right for any arrested person to be informed of the reasons for their arrest is a procedural guarantee that cannot be subject to any restriction or limitation, at all times and under all circumstances.\\n\\n**The right to be presumed innocent**\\n\\nThe right for any accused and detained person to be presumed innocent is clearly stated in **Article 40** of the **Constitution**, which provides that \"*everyone accused of a criminal act is presumed innocent until their guilt has been legally established during a public trial in which all necessary guarantees for their free defense have been ensured*.\"\\n\\n**The right to be assisted by a lawyer**\\n\\nThe right to be assisted by a lawyer is recognized by the **Code of Criminal Procedure**. Indeed, within **Article 95** of this code, it is stated that \"*the alleged perpetrator of an offense benefits from all necessary guarantees for the exercise of the right to defense. To this end, it is guaranteed to them in particular (...) to choose a Counsel*.\"\\n\\n**The right not to be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment or treatment**\\n\\nThe **Constitution** recognizes, in **Article 25**, that \"*no one shall be subjected to torture, nor to cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment or treatment*.\" Thus, the **Constitution** of Burundi prohibits any recourse to torture or to cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment or treatment. Torture is defined in **Article 204** of the **Penal Code** as corresponding to \"*any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for the purpose of obtaining from them or a third person information or confessions, punishing them for an act that they or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, intimidating or coercing them, or for any other reason based on any form of discrimination, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by a public agent or any other person acting in an official capacity or at their instigation or with their express or tacit consent*.\" Any harm to a person is therefore an illegal act. Any violation will be punished with a sanction. Indeed, according to **Article 205** of the **Penal Code**: \"*whoever subjects a person to torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment is punishable by penal servitude of ten to fifteen years and a fine of one hundred thousand to one million francs*.\"', \"satisfy the conditions of Article 154, paragraph 2, the Judge may, if the accused requests it, order that he be released provisionally, on the condition that he deposits with the Clerk, as a bail, a sum of money.\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**www.droit‐afrique.com** **Burundi**\\n\\nThis bail guarantees the appearance of the accused at all stages of the proceedings and his compliance with custodial sentences as soon as required, if applicable, the compensation for damages caused by the offense, the payment of fines, and legal costs.\\n\\n**Art.161.‐ The provisions of the previous article do not apply to:**\\n\\n1° Persons prosecuted for a crime punishable by more than twenty years of imprisonment;\\n\\n2° Persons who have not yet returned the sums of money or any other property obtained through the offense or, failing that, their equivalent;\\n\\n3° Persons prosecuted for sexual violence.\\n\\n**Art.162.‐ The bail is refunded in case of dismissal of the case,** release from detention, withdrawal of the benefit of provisional release, or acquittal.\\n\\nThe refund of the bail deposited during provisional release is ordered by the Public Prosecutor's Officer of the jurisdiction that decided it.\\n\\nIn case of flight, the bail is forfeited to the public treasury, without prejudice to the rights of the civil party and after deducting the costs that the failure to appear may have incurred.\\n\\nThe refund is made by the competent jurisdiction in the case of bail ordered by the judge.\\n\\n**Section 2 ‐ Provisional Release**\\n\\n**Art.163.‐ Provisional release is granted on the condition that the accused does not obstruct** the investigation and does not cause a scandal by his conduct.\\n\\nThe judge may also impose on the accused:\\n\\n- 1° to reside in the locality where the Public Prosecutor's Officer has his seat;\\n\\n- 2° not to stray beyond a certain radius of the locality, without authorization from the investigating magistrate or his delegate;\\n\\n- 3° not to go to places he determines, such as airports, ports, and train stations, or not to be there at specified times;\\n\\n- 4° to periodically present himself before the investigating magistrate or before any official or agent designated by him;\\n\\n- 5° to appear before the investigating magistrate or before the judge as soon as required;\\n\\n- 6° not to contact his victims or other persons he...\", 'The principle of legal certainty requires that this guilt be demonstrated and established with absolute certainty, leaving no room for doubt on the matter. This illustrates the judicial adage upon which a fair system rests: Better to free a hundred guilty than to condemn a single innocent. This is not a choice.

It is in no way the responsibility of the defense to provide any evidence of innocence.\\n\\nIt is evident in practice that the defense fights with elements it believes are capable of demonstrating the defendant\\'s innocence. Of course, one should not refrain from doing so.\\n\\nHowever, it is fundamental to always recall the principle above and to expend considerable energy in demonstrating the shortcomings of the prosecution\\'s case before engaging in the demonstration of innocence.\\n\\nThe opposite is illogical, and yet, this is a reflex we all have, which gradually establishes a practice contrary to the presumption of innocence.\\n\\nLet us remember that it is difficult to provide negative proof (what the accused did not do) and that it is much easier to demonstrate the shortcomings of the prosecution (what it does not demonstrate).\\n\\nLet us therefore state things clearly to the Court and to the accuser, and refuse to allow the belief that an acquittal is granted \"in the benefit of the doubt.\"\\n\\n---\\n\\nSee  [Petit Manuel de Défense Pénale](/index.php?title=Burundi \"Burundi\")\\n\\nRetrieved from \"<https://defensewiki.ibj.org/index.php?title=Petit_Manuel_de_Défense_Pénale_du_Burundi_-_Stratégies_de_Défense&oldid=7007>\" and not translating the text in the sources and references (articles, links,...)']], 'uris': None, 'included': ['documents', 'metadatas', 'distances'], 'data': None, 'metadatas': [[{'chunk_count': 0, 'language': 'en', 'country': 'Burundi', 'title': 'Manuel_sur_les_procedures_darrestation_et_de_detention_instituees_par_le_Code_de_Procedure_Penale_du_Burundi', 'last-edited': '30 November 2010, 14:25', 'link': 'https://defensewiki.ibj.org/index.php?title=Manuel_sur_les_proc%C3%A9dures_d%E2%80%99arrestation_et_de_d%C3%A9tention_institu%C3%A9es_par_le_Code_de_Proc%C3%A9dure_P%C3%A9nale_du_Burundi', 'viewcount': 'This page has been accessed 13,734 times.', 'section_short': 'Toutefois, en attendant qu’un jugement de condamnation', 'type': 'defensewiki_doc', 'extracted': '2025-03-20 20:02:08', 'title_bis': 'defensewiki_doc.Manuel_sur_les_procedures_darrestation_et_de_detention_instituees_par_le_Code_de_Procedure_Penale_du_Burundi.Toutefois, en attendant qu’un jugement de condamnation.0'}, {'section_short': 'La présomption d’innocence', 'language': 'en', 'country': 'Burundi', 'viewcount': 'This page has been accessed 7,217 times.', 'chunk_count': 0, 'last-edited': '15 November 2010, 14:34', 'type': 'defensewiki_doc', 'title': 'Petit_Manuel_de_Defense_Penale_du_Burundi_-_Principes_Fondamentaux', 'title_bis': 'defensewiki_doc.Petit_Manuel_de_Defense_Penale_du_Burundi_-_Principes_Fondamentaux.La présomption d’innocence.0', 'link': 'https://defensewiki.ibj.org/index.php?title=Petit_Manuel_de_D%C3%A9fense_P%C3%A9nale_du_Burundi_-_Principes_Fondamentaux', 'extracted': '2025-03-20 20:01:23'}, {'title_bis': 'defensewiki_doc.Burundi-fr.Les droits de l’accusé et du détenu.0', 'title': 'Burundi-fr', 'chunk_count': 0, 'link': 'https://defensewiki.ibj.org/index.php?title=Burundi/fr', 'type': 'defensewiki_doc', 'last-edited': '24 August 2017, 09:32', 'viewcount': 'This page has been accessed 92,821 times.', 'country': 'Burundi', 'section_short': 'Les droits de l’accusé et du détenu', 'extracted': '2025-03-20 19:56:01', 'language': 'en'}, {'language': 'en', 'website': '', 'legal_type': 'penal_procedure', 'country': 'Burundi', 'legal_relevance': 'national', 'publication_date': '2018-05-11', 'chunk_count': 0, 'title_bis': 'Burundi.satisfaire aux conditions de l’article 154 alinéa.0', 'section_short': 'satisfaire aux conditions de l’article 154 alinéa', 'legal_status': '', 'year': '2018', 'path': 'data/raw/legal_countries_docs_pdfs/Burundi-Code-2018-procedure-penale.pdf', 'filename': 'Burundi-Code-2018-procedure-penale.pdf'}, {'chunk_count': 2, 'viewcount': 'This page has been accessed 13,041 times.', 'last-edited': '15 November 2010, 14:36', 'language': 'en', 'country': 'Burundi', 'title': 'Petit_Manuel_de_Defense_Penale_du_Burundi_-_Strategies_de_Defense', 'extracted': '2025-03-20 20:00:33', 'link': 'https://defensewiki.ibj.org/index.php?title=Petit_Manuel_de_D%C3%A9fense_P%C3%A9nale_du_Burundi_-_Strat%C3%A9gies_de_D%C3%A9fense', 'title_bis': 'defensewiki_doc.Petit_Manuel_de_Defense_Penale_du_Burundi_-_Strategies_de_Defense.Culpabilité admise ou contestée.2', 'section_short': 'Culpabilité admise ou contestée', 'type': 'defensewiki_doc'}]], 'distances': [[0.6695973873138428, 0.7122570872306824, 0.8246705532073975, 0.8255937099456787, 0.8308433294296265]]}\n"
